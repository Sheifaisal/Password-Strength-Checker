## 🟢 1. Password Strength Checker

**🎯 Objective:**
A program that checks if a password is strong or weak, based on rules (length, numbers, special characters, etc.).

**🧠 Key Concepts Learned:**

* Regex (pattern matching)
* Security best practices for passwords
* Importance of entropy in password strength

**⚙️ Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Regex (`re` module)

**📝 Steps:**

1. Accept a password as input.
2. Check for conditions:

   * Length ≥ 8
   * Contains uppercase + lowercase letters
   * At least 1 number
   * At least 1 special character
3. Give a score (Weak / Medium / Strong).

**🚀 Extra Features:**

* Estimate “time to crack” using brute force.
* Suggest stronger password alternatives.

## 🟢 2. Phishing URL Detector

**🎯 Objective:**
A small ML model/app that detects if a given URL is legitimate or a phishing attempt.

**🧠 Key Concepts Learned:**

* Feature extraction from URLs
* ML classification (binary: phishing or safe)
* Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with TF-IDF

**⚙️ Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `re`

**📝 Steps:**

1. Collect a dataset (legit + phishing URLs). Example: PhishTank dataset.
2. Extract features:

   * Length of URL
   * Presence of `@` or `//`
   * Number of dots in domain
   * HTTPS vs HTTP
   * Use TF-IDF on the domain name/text.
3. Train ML model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest).
4. Test with new URLs.

**🚀 Extra Features:**

* Build a small **Flask web app** where users paste a URL to check.
* Integrate with browser extension (advanced).

## 🟢 3. Basic Keylogger (Ethical Demo)

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Keyloggers can be misused. This should only be built **for learning in a controlled environment**. Never deploy it on someone else’s system without consent.

**🎯 Objective:**
Capture keystrokes and store them in a local file.

**🧠 Key Concepts Learned:**

* Keyboard event hooks
* System monitoring basics
* Awareness of how malware works

**⚙️ Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Library: `pynput`

**📝 Steps:**

1. Install `pynput` (`pip install pynput`).
2. Write a program to listen for keystrokes.
3. Save keystrokes in a `.txt` file.
4. Stop logging when a certain key (like `Esc`) is pressed.

**🚀 Extra Features:**

* Timestamp each keystroke.
* Encrypt the log file (AES).
* Visualize keystroke patterns (forensics demo).

✅ These three projects will give you a **solid beginner foundation** in cybersecurity, covering:

* **Password Security**
* **Phishing/ML Security**
* **System Security Awareness**
